# Pornsorter

A quick and dirty thing for sorting out wallpapers ripped from places like /r/EarthPorn. (I use [RipMe](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme).) Or wallpaper-size actual porn. I don't care, you filthy animal.

## Usage

python3 pornsorter.py \<dir_to_scan\> \<dir_to_move_to\>

Desired aspect ratios and minimum resolutions can be set using the marked variables at the top of the script.

## Dependencies

* Pillow / PIL

## Todo

* Allow tolerances to include images that fall within x% of a preferred aspect ratio.
